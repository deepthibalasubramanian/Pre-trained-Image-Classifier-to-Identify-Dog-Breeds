Answer:
resnet model classified all four images correctly and exhibits 100% accuracy in classifying the provided images, but takes double the time as alexnet model, which classified images as dogs and not-dogs, but classified a pencil to be a shovel, which is incorrect. So, considering the efficiency in classification of all 4 images correctly, alexnet classified at a higher accuracy in a short span of time. If time is not a constraint of much importance, resnet could be a better model. But in most cases, VGG model has the most accuracy.
